# Phase 2 Project - Kanto Kollection

This application has a special place in my heart as it was my first ever React JS application with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) capabilities. 
And it has Pokemon in it! 

<h3> What does this application do? </h3>
It was made as part of my Software Engineering course at Academy Xi (Flatiron School).
It is a React JS application which allows the user to add a Pokemon to their collection, rename it at will and then send it to Team Rocket's boss (delete it). 
This then updates the total count of Pokemon which have been sent to the boss with a useRef hook. 
All user actions interact with a local JSON server. 

<h3> What technologies does it use? </h3>
It uses: 
<ul>
<li>React JS</li>
<li>Vanilla CSS</li>
<li>A single Bootstrap Button component</li>
</ul>

<h3> How to run it? </h3>
<ul>
<li>cd into folder</li>
<li>run npm install</li>
<li>start the json server with "json-server --watch db.json" </li>
<li>if the previous step fails, "run npm install --save json-server" and repeat previous step</li>
<li>run npm start </li>
</ul>
